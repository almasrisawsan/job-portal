React Project Folder Structure Guidelines

Routes Management
    - All routes are defined in the routes.ts file.
    - When adding a new route, make sure to include it in this file.

Pages and Components
    - Each page should be created inside the routes folder.
    - If a page requires custom UI or logic, create a dedicated component for it.
    - If a component is shared across multiple pages, place it in the root components folder for better reusability.

Layout Components
    - The Navbar and Footer files are predefinedâ€”add or modify them only where specified.

Routing Reference
    - For more information on using path parameters and other routing features, refer to the official React Router documentation:
